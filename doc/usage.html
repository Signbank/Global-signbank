<h1>Signbank User Guide</h1>

<p>
    This page gives a brief overview of the functionality of the Signbank website.
</p>

<h2>Public View</h2>

<p>
    A user who is not logged in will be able to perform a keyword search and will
    see pages that match a given keyword; each page represents one sign and links
    are provided to other matches for that keyword.  Keyword searches are based on
    the start of the word, so a search for 'ab' will find all keywords starting with those letters.
</p>

<p>
    The view shown to a public user includes the video for the sign (if any), the
    keywords associated with the sign, and a list of definitions (noun, verb etc).
    The definitions that are shown on this page can be customised for a given Signbank
    site; for example, it is possible to show no definitions at all, even if they have
    been entered into the database.
</p>

<p>
    This page can be configured to show links to the next/previous sign in the dictionary. 
    These links will only work reliably if sign numbers have been used consistently 
    in the dictionary since these define the order of signs.  These links can be turned
    off for a particular Signbank.
</p>

<h2>Logged In Public View</h2>

<p>
    A member of the public can register for the site and is then given the option
    of providing feedback on individual signs.  Feedback can include uploading a video.
    The feedback and any video is only ever visible to staff and is never made publicly
    available.
</p>

<h2>Staff Access</h2>

<p>
    A number of different levels of staff access are possible, the different capabilities
    are summarised later.  This section gives a summary of all of the different staff capabilities.
<p>

<p>
    At present, a user can only be given staff status by the administrator (Steve Cassidy),
    in the future some level of control over this may be added to the normal site owner capabilities.
    For now, please send a request to change a user's status to me.
</p>

<p>
    Once a staff user is logged in they will see an additional menu containing links to staff only options.
    Other pages (such as this one) can also be limited to certain groups of users.
</p>

<h3>Sign Search</h3>

<p>
    Staff have access to a more advanced search page for signs that includes all fields associated
    with signs and associated tags.  The search form is shown at the top of the page, by default only
    the SN/Gloss and keyword search boxes are visible. There is an "Advanced Search" bar
    which will show more search options when clicked. Below the search from there is
    also an option to add a new sign.
</p>

<p>
    The Search Gloss/SN field allows a search on either the sign number (SN), ID Gloss or
    Annotation ID Gloss.  The search is on the first characters of these fields so entering
    'ab' will show all signs with an ID Gloss or Annotation ID Gloss starting with these
    letters; entering '12' will show signs with a sign number starting with these digits.
    The keyword field allows search on the keywords associated with a sign in the same manner
    as the public search option, however this version is not limited to published signs.
    The user can just hit Enter or click on the Search button to perform the search.
</p>

<p>
    Searches in the form use an implicit AND between fields - that is, if you enter 'ab'
    in the Gloss field and 'dry' in the keyword field you would see signs with an ID Gloss
    starting with 'ab' which also have a keyword 'dry' (eg. ABSORB in BSL Signbank).
</p>

<p>
    Search results are shown in the list below the form, a summary of the number of
    matches to the search term is also shown.  The results are shown in a table which
    lists the Sign Number, ID Gloss, Annotation ID Gloss, Morphology and tags associated
    with each matching sign. The sign number (which may be None if no sign number is set) is
    a link to a page that displays the full details of the sign.
</p>

<p>
    Another option from this page is to export a version of the search results as a CSV
    (spreadsheet) file.   If you click on this button instead of the Search button the results
    will be downloaded as <code>dictionary-export.csv</code>.  This file contains all of the
    fields stored with each sign as well as the keywords and tags.  No definitions or notes
    are included in the CSV file.
</p>

<h2>Sign Detail View</h2>

<p>
    If you click on a sign in the search results you will be taken to a detailed view of 
    that sign, this is a variation on the view shown to the public but has much more detail. It 
    includes all fields in the database and allows a user with the required permissions to edit
    the sign entry.  
</p>

<p>
    The sign detail page shows a video if one has been uploaded for this sign. Below the video is
    a list of  <strong>tags</strong> that have been associated with the sign.  Tags encode binary
    properties of a sign and each tag has a prefix that groups them together. For example 
    <code>semantic:education</code> or <code>phonology:two handed</code>.  New tags can only be 
    added by the site administrator (but adding them is straightforward).
</p>

<p>
    On the right of the page the properties of the sign are listed. These are grouped together and
    by default only the basic properties are shown. Clicking on the grey title bars show the fields
    for 'Publication Status', 'Phonology', 'Relations to Other Signs' or 'Definitions/Notes'.  In the
    case that there is no value in the database for a field 'No Value Set' is shown.  Most fields also
    have a special value 'N/A' which can be used to signify 'Not Applicable'; the intention is to be able
    to tell the difference between 'value not yet entered' and 'this field does not apply to this sign'. 
</p>

<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>
    If the user has the required permission, a blue "Enable Edit" button shows at the top right of 
    the page.  When clicked, this will turn red and enable editing of all fields for the sign.  A new
    "Delete Sign" button will appear and all editable fields will turn red. To modify a field, click on
    the red text and make the required change (this will either be a text entry, a checkbox or a 
    selection from a list).  Buttons for OK and Cancel will appear, clicking Ok will save the change
    and Cancel will revert to the previous value.  All changes take effect immediately. 
</p>

<p>
    The "Delete Sign" button will show a dialogue box that asks the user to confirm the deletion of 
    the sign entry.  Clicking on "Confirm Delete" will delete the entry and return to the sign
    search page.  Clicking on "Cancel" will return to the sign page.
</p>

<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>
    In the "Relations to Other Signs" tab, any relations such as Synonyn, Homonym etc are show.
    The target sign is shown as the sign number followed by the ID Gloss, eg. 10620-about2a.
    In edit mode the text of the role (Synonym) and target sign are shown red and can be edited. 
    When editing the target sign, enter either the ID Gloss, Annotation ID Gloss or Sign Number of
    the sign you want to link to, you will see a list of possible completions as you type. Click 
    on the required sign once you see it in the list.  The text box will show the sign ID Gloss
    followed by a number in brackets. This number is an internal identifier, not the sign number. 
    When you click "OK" the change will be made and the SN-ID Gloss form will be shown.
    A relation can also be deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon at the start of each line.
</p>

<p>
    Below the list of relations in edit mode is a form to create a new relation. Select the role from
    the drop down list and enter the target sign as above.  When you click "Add Relation" the page
    will refresh, you will need to click on the "Relations to Other Signs" tab to see the new entry.
</p>

<h3>Definitions and Notes</h3>
<p>
    In the "Definitions/Notes" tab a list of defnitions or notes is shown. Each of these has
    a "Role" label such as "As a Noun", "Private Note" etc.  and an integer "Index" that defines
    the order within the category when they are listed on the public pages.   Each entry also has
    a "Published" field which controls whether the definition or note can be shown in the public
    view.  A definition/note can also be deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon at the start
    of each row.
</p>

<p>
    Below the list of definitions/notes in edit mode is a form to create a new entry.  As with the
    relation form, the page will refresh when you submit this form and you will need to click on
    the "Definitions/Notes" tab again to view the change.  By default, new definitions have the
    Published field set to No.
</p>

<h3>Video</h3>

<p>
    In edit mode, a form to allow upload of video will be shown below the video for the sign. Select
    a file and click "Upload Video" and the page will refresh and the new video should be show. In 
    edit mode, a count of the number of videos for this sign is shown.  Each time you upload a new
    video, the old one is retained but the new one is shown in preference.  If there is at least one
    video for a sign, a button is shown below the upload form to allow deletion of the current
    video. Clicking this button will delete the current video and revert to an earlier version if
    present.  If there is only one video then no video will be shown for the sign.  
</p>

<p>
    Videos uploaded should be saved in a web friendly format. Technically this is H264 encoded video, 
    but most programs that save video for the web will use this format. There is no requirement on
    the name of the video file, whatever file you upload will be associated with this sign.
     Videos are displayed in 320x240 
    pixels and so you should save them at this size for best performance, however higher resolution
    videos will be ok (but will be slower to play, eg. on the mobile version of the site). 
</p>


<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>
    Below the video forms is a list of tags associated with this sign.  In edit mode a small red 
    cross will appear in each tag. Clicking on this cross will delete the tag.  New tags can be 
    added via the dropdown menu below the tags. 
</p>


<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>
    It will be possible to finely control the level of access for different groups of users. At
    present we have three groups:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Editor: full edit access, can change anything, upload and delete videos etc.</li>
    <li>Researcher: full search access to see the detailed view of signs, no edit access.</li>
    <li>Public: only keyword search and the ability to leave feedback on signs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In future we will develop a richer set of user levels, we've had some discussion about
    this and will make a proposal for feedback.
</p>
